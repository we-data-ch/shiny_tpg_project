## Serverless Shiny App or classical Shiny App?

We decided that creating a classical Shiny App is more feasible and gives more flexibility. We also highlighted that the loading time of a serverless ShinyApp is quite slow.

## What project?

[The "Transport Public Genevois" (TPG) open dataset](https://opendata.tpg.ch/explore/?sort=title) will be used to create a map of isolated bus stations. We also want to join theses data with other datasets:

-   Swiss Federal Statistical Office: <https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics.html>

-   Geneva Statisitcal Office: <https://statistique.ge.ch/>

-   Transport opendata: <https://transport.opendata.ch/>

-   Swiss Open data: <https://opendata.swiss/en>

-   Google map

## Next steps

1.  Explore the datasets
2.  Gather learning ressources for all
3.  Find a catchy name for the project
