## New Plan, Big Plan

We have a new direction for the ShinyApp suggested by Kenneth. The goal is to create an interactive map of the bus stops, close to one of the [TPG](https://opendata.tpg.ch/pages/accueil/). We will add more information like the bus paths. The aim will be to highlight areas where there might be too many bus stops. All the details can be found [here](https://github.com/we-data-ch/shiny_tpg_project/blob/master/Ideas/kr_01.md#pitch).
